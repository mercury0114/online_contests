For online coding contests, such as Google KickStart.

The following is an example usage how to run the code for the first problem in the contest:
```shell
./cpp_run.sh example_contest 1
```

If you want to run your code for an arbitrary contest C:
- Create a top level directory named `C`
- Inside C add your solution file `codeX.cpp` to the problem X and an input data file `inputX.txt`
- run the command `./cpp_run.sh C X`
